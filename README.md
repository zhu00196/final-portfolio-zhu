The final assignment for web development

<!-- Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?" Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. -->



I create this website based on my assignment for the user experience.

My website is a showcase for my works of videos. Also, I'm good at graphic, photo, CMS, videography, 3D animation, SEO, social media, marketing, etc.
I design this website to show I'm a solution of marketing.

My process of creating this website is as below:
1. analyse the website to know the main structure 
2. review the content in class in BrightSpace
3. create four main categories and basic files
4. Build basic code structure and connect files
5. find element in Bootstrap to start
6. finish the main content
7. optimize the files
8. link the nav and footer part and some other link
9. sychronize the files to github and make the online web


The difficulty is that it's hard to make the almost same structure as my figma design. All the content is new and very different from the traditional coding.

I think the Bootstrap is like a template coding resource for us. It makes coding easier and minimize the working time with CMS system. 



All the content in this website is made by my own.
The images are made by Blender years ago.
The videos is create by PR, AE, C4d, etc.
